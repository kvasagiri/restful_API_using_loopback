# Building a RESTful API Using LoopBack

LoopBack, an easy to learn and understand open-source Node.js framework, allows you to create end-to-end REST APIs with less code compared to Express and other frameworks. It allows you to create your basic routes on adding a model into the application. 

Data can be accessed from multiple databases such as MySQL, MongoDB, Oracle, MS SQL, PostgreSQL, and so on.
